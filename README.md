Plaenkler/Booklooker enables HTTP requests to be made to the Booklooker API. The library abstracts the constructs and allows developers to interact with the Booklooker API through a convenient and intuitive interface.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project goals

- [x] Implementation of all models and handlers
- [x] Client with automatic token renewal
- [x] Implementation of one example for each handler

## âœ… Examples

A separate example has been implemented for each interface of the API. All examples use the client for authentication except the authentication example itself if there is a desire to implement a separate client.
